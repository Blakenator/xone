xone is a Linux kernel driver for Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S accessories. It serves as a modern replacement for `xpad`, aiming to be compatible with Microsoft's *Game Input Protocol* (GIP).
If you are looking for a way to use your controller via Bluetooth, check out [xpadneo](https://github.com/atar-axis/xpadneo).

## Compatibility

Take a look at [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fVGtqHTo9PRdmFVgEjmWuJIjuYEE_OziktNifFZIEgg) for a comparison between all the different Linux drivers and the devices they support.

**Wireless accessories using the Xbox Wireless dongle need to use the [experimental](https://github.com/medusalix/xone/tree/experimental) branch of `xone`**

## Important notes

This driver is still in active development. Use at your own risk!
If you are running `xow` upgrading to `xone` is *highly recommended*!

3. Restart your computer
